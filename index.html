    Congrats on finally catching up, it's about time. It's been lonely here in 23 by myself. DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE HERE WITH JUST CHRIS?! Then again I guess Frank is 23 too.... ANYWAYS, Here's to many more brother and here's to being able to celebrate them together! I owe you a drink next time we see each other. Until then, stay safe, don't be dumb, don't go to jail and you know the rest. Thanks for being my brother. Until next time. <br>
    Your Brother, <br>
    Sam. <br>
